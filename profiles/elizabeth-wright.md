Elizabeth Wright is a Professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. She is the director of the Cryo-EM Research Center (CEMRC) at UW-Madison and the Midwest Center for Cryo-Electron Tomography (MCCET), an NIH-funded National Center for Cryo-ET. She earned her PhD in Chemistry at Emory University in the laboratory of Prof. Vincent P. Conticello. It was during her PhD studies that she first began to explore macromolecular complexes and cellular systems with electron microscopy (EM) and cryo-EM. She joined Grant’s lab at Caltech as a postdoc from 2003-2008. In Grant’s lab she used cryo-ET to study HIV maturation, bacterial structure, and bacteria-bacteriophage interactions. In 2008, she established her cryo-EM lab where the group explores structure-function questions related to pathogenic viruses and bacteria, bacteriophage, blood cells and macromolecules, and neurons.
