Morgan Beeby is a group leader at Imperial College London. In London. He earned his PhD with Todd O. Yeates at UCLA where he developed interests in evolution, bioinformatics, and structural biology. Electron cryotomography was the clear next step, prompting him to join Grantâ€™s lab as a postdoc from 2008 to 2012. In 2013 he established his own lab using cryoET as the backbone of an interdisciplinary research program to understand the evolution of molecular machines, with a focus on bacterial flagella.
