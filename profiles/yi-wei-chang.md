Yi-Wei Chang is a structural biology enthusiast and principal investigator at the University of Pennsylvania. Yi-Wei received his Ph.D. degree from National Tsing-Hua University and Academia Sinica in Taiwan, working with Chwan-Deng Hsiao in using X-ray crystallography to study atomic structural details of purified proteins. After being astonished by Grant Jensenâ€™s visiting seminar at Academia Sinica highlighting the power of cryo-electron tomography in resolving macromolecular structures directly in cellular contexts, Yi-Wei set this as his long term research direction and was lucky enough to join the Jensen laboratory at Caltech in 2011 as a postdoctoral scholar. After years of working with the amazing group to master cryo-electron tomography methods and visualize fascinating macromolecular structures in situ, Yi-Wei launched his own laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in 2019 to continue exploring the magnificent in-cell structural biology and to nurture the next generation of outstanding scientists.
