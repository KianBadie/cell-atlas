Alasdair McDowall is manager for the laboratory of Grant Jensen at Caltech. He is a career electron microscopist of 48 years and has managed, designed and directed microscopy centers and resources in the UK, USA, Germany and Australia. He is Emeritus Professor at the University of Queensland, Australia. He received his Doctorate from the University of Sorbonne, Paris.  His thesis was enhanced by the unique discovery in 1981 when Dubochet and McDowall at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) reported the first vitrification of water at ambient pressures as seen in the electron microscope.  This landmark result pioneered research that evolved into modern day molecular cryo-electron microscopy and the awarding of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Dubochet, Henderson and Frank. In 2019 he was appointed a Queen Elizabeth II honors recipient, and awarded Member of the Order of Australia.  “For significant service to science, particularly in the field of electron microscopy”.
