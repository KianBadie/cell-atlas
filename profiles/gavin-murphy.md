Following his graduation from the University of Dallas, Gavin Murphy spent two years studying X-ray crystallography as a Fulbright Scholar at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Hamburg, Germany. He then joined the lab of Grant Jensen at Caltech, applying cryo-electron tomography to solve the structures of bacterial macromolecular machinery. He received his doctorate in 2007, for work that included one of the first subtomogram averages ever published, revealing the ultrastructure of the flagellar motor. Wanting to make a more direct impact on human health, in his postdoctoral work with Sriram Subramanian at the National Institutes of Health he developed and applied methods for focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to visualize large volumes of eukaryotic cells and tissue. In 2012, Gavin became Director of the Electron Microscopy Center at Indiana University Bloomington. He died in 2017, and is fondly remembered and greatly missed by his colleagues.
