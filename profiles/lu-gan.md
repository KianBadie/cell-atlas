Lu Gan is a principal investigator in the Centre for BioImaging Sciences and Department of Biological Sciences at the National University of Singapore. He did his undergraduate training at Caltech, where he studied antibody trafficking in Professor Pamela Bjorkman’s lab. Lu then received PhD training in structural virology with Professor Jack Johnson at The Scripps Research Institute. In 2006, he joined Grant Jensen’s lab as a postdoctoral scholar to study both bacterial cell-wall architecture and eukaryotic chromosome segregation. He moved to Singapore in 2011 to start his independent lab. Lu and his students continue to explore eukaryotic chromosomes and how they are regulated, all at molecular resolution.
