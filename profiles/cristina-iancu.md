Cristina V. Iancu received her B.S. in Biophysics from the Faculty of Physics of the University of Bucharest, Romania, and her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Iowa State University, Ames, IA, U.S. Her graduate work in the protein crystallography group of Dr. Richard B. Honzatko involved structural and functional studies of key enzymes in gluconeogenesis and de novo nucleotide synthesis. She joined the cryo-EM lab of Dr. Grant J. Jensen as his first postdoc, where she worked on cryo-ET method development projects and cryo-ET structure determination of protein complexes, isolated carboxysomes, and carboxysome-producing bacteria. Currently, she works on drug discovery targeting carbohydrate transporters with Dr. Jun-yong Choe.
