I received Bachelor degree in Chemistry from Peking University, China and Ph.D. in biophysics and molecular physiology from School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, USA. At Vanderbilt, I worked in Dr. Phoebe Stewart's lab to study small heat shock proteins with CryoEM and other biophysical methods. After Ph.D., I joined Dr. Grant Jensen's lab at Caltech/HHMI as CryoEM specialist to study ultra-structures in bacteria. After spending one year in FEI Company, I have been the manager of Cryo-Electron Microscopy Facility at National University of Singapore since then.
