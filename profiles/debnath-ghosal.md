Debnath Ghosal is a senior lecturer at University of Melbourne. Debnath received his PhD degree in structural biology from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (University of Cambridge, Darwin College), where he worked with Dr. Jan Lowe on bacterial cell division. Subsequently, he joined Dr. Grant Jensen's laboratory at Caltech for his postdoctoral training. At Caltech, he investigated the structure and function of bacterial secretion systems using electron cryotomography. Debnath established his own laboratory at University of Melbourne in 2020. His group is working on the structural and molecular biology of large bacterial protein complexes that are important for pathogenesis.
