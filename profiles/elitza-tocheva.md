Dr. Elitza Tocheva graduated with her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of British Columbia in 2007, where she worked on characterizing the mechanism of bacterial enzymes involved in denitrification. She continued her structural biology studies as a postdoctoral scholar in the laboratory of Dr. Grant Jensen at Caltech where she applied cryo electron tomography and correlative microscopy approaches to study the ultrastructure of bacteria. She joined Université de Montréal as an Assistant Professor in June of 2015 and in January of 2019 was recruited to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at UBC. Her lab combines microbiology, biochemistry and structural biology to study sporulation, membrane biogenesis, and host-pathogen interactions.
