## Morgan Beeby {-#morgan_beeby}

Morgan Beeby is a group leader at Imperial College London. In London. He earned his PhD with Todd O. Yeates at UCLA where he developed interests in evolution, bioinformatics, and structural biology. Electron cryotomography was the clear next step, prompting him to join Grantâ€™s lab as a postdoc from 2008 to 2012. In 2013 he established his own lab using cryoET as the backbone of an interdisciplinary research program to understand the evolution of molecular machines, with a focus on bacterial flagella.

## Ariane Briegel {-#ariane_briegel}

Ariane Briegel is Professor of Ultrastructural Biology at the Leiden University (The Netherlands) and co-director of the Dutch center for electron Nanoscopy (NeCEN). She earned her PhD in the laboratory of Prof. Wolfgang Baumeister at the Max Planck Institute in Martinsried Germany. Here, she learned the power of Electron Tomography to study microbes in three dimensions and at macromolecular resolution. She continued to explore the wonders of bacterial structure and function in the laboratory of Grant Jensen as a postdoc and research scientist. She  has 20 years of experience using cryo-electron microscopy to study bacterial and archaeal ultrastructure. The Briegel laboratory focuses on investigating how microbes sense and respond to their environment using cryoEM methods.

## Debnath Ghosal {-#debnath_ghosal}

Debnath Ghosal is a senior lecturer at University of Melbourne. Debnath received his PhD degree in structural biology from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (University of Cambridge, Darwin College), where he worked with Dr. Jan Lowe on bacterial cell division. Subsequently, he joined Dr. Grant Jensen's laboratory at Caltech for his postdoctoral training. At Caltech, he investigated the structure and function of bacterial secretion systems using electron cryotomography. Debnath established his own laboratory at University of Melbourne in 2020. His group is working on the structural and molecular biology of large bacterial protein complexes that are important for pathogenesis.

## Gregory Henderson {-#gregory_henderson}

## Cristina Iancu {-#cristina_iancu}

## Grant Jensen {-#grant_jensen}

Grant J. Jensen is a Professor of Biology and Biophysics at Caltech. He earned his doctorate in Biophysics from Stanford, working on electron microscopy of RNA polymerase and other protein complexes with Dr. Roger Kornberg. He continued his work in protein electron microscopy as a Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell post-doctoral fellow under the supervision of Dr. Kenneth Downing at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Here his interests expanded to include electron tomography of whole cells. Grant launched his own lab at Caltech in 2002, where his research has focused on three main areas: the ultrastructure of small cells, the structural biology of HIV, and the further development of cryoEM technology.

## Gavin Murphy {-#gavin_murphy}

Following his graduation from the University of Dallas, Gavin Murphy spent two years studying X-ray crystallography as a Fulbright Scholar at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Hamburg, Germany. He then joined the lab of Grant Jensen at Caltech, applying cryo-electron tomography to solve the structures of bacterial macromolecular machinery. He received his doctorate in 2007, for work that included one of the first subtomogram averages ever published, revealing the ultrastructure of the flagellar motor. Wanting to make a more direct impact on human health, in his postdoctoral work with Sriram Subramanian at the National Institutes of Health he developed and applied methods for focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to visualize large volumes of eukaryotic cells and tissue. In 2012, Gavin became Director of the Electron Microscopy Center at Indiana University Bloomington. He died in 2017, and is fondly remembered and greatly missed by his colleagues.

## Catherine Oikonomou {-#catherine_oikonomou}

Catherine M. Oikonomou is a research scientist and science writer at Caltech. She received her doctorate from the Rockefeller University, where she worked with Dr. Frederick Cross on cell cycle control in budding yeast. In 2012, she joined the lab of Dr. Grant Jensen at Caltech, where she has been exploring microbial cell biology through cryo-electron tomography.
