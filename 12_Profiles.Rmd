## Morgan Beeby {-#morgan_beeby}

Morgan Beeby is a group leader at Imperial College London. In London. He earned his PhD with Todd O. Yeates at UCLA where he developed interests in evolution, bioinformatics, and structural biology. Electron cryotomography was the clear next step, prompting him to join Grant’s lab as a postdoc from 2008 to 2012. In 2013 he established his own lab using cryoET as the backbone of an interdisciplinary research program to understand the evolution of molecular machines, with a focus on bacterial flagella.

## Yi-Wei Chang {-#yi-wei_chang}

Yi-Wei Chang is a structural biology enthusiast and principal investigator at the University of Pennsylvania. Yi-Wei received his Ph.D. degree from National Tsing-Hua University and Academia Sinica in Taiwan, working with Chwan-Deng Hsiao in using X-ray crystallography to study atomic structural details of purified proteins. After being astonished by Grant Jensen’s visiting seminar at Academia Sinica highlighting the power of cryo-electron tomography in resolving macromolecular structures directly in cellular contexts, Yi-Wei set this as his long term research direction and was lucky enough to join the Jensen laboratory at Caltech in 2011 as a postdoctoral scholar. After years of working with the amazing group to master cryo-electron tomography methods and visualize fascinating macromolecular structures in situ, Yi-Wei launched his own laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in 2019 to continue exploring the magnificent in-cell structural biology and to nurture the next generation of outstanding scientists.

Honzatko involved structural and functional studies of key enzymes in gluconeogenesis and de novo nucleotide synthesis. She joined the cryo-EM lab of Dr. Grant J. Jensen as his first postdoc, where she worked on cryo-ET method development projects and cryo-ET structure determination of protein complexes, isolated carboxysomes, and carboxysome-producing bacteria. Currently, she works on drug discovery targeting carbohydrate transporters with Dr. Jun-yong Choe.

## Grant Jensen {-#grant_jensen}

Grant J. Jensen is a Professor of Biology and Biophysics at Caltech. He earned his doctorate in Biophysics from Stanford, working on electron microscopy of RNA polymerase and other protein complexes with Dr. Roger Kornberg. He continued his work in protein electron microscopy as a Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell post-doctoral fellow under the supervision of Dr. Kenneth Downing at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Here his interests expanded to include electron tomography of whole cells. Grant launched his own lab at Caltech in 2002, where his research has focused on three main areas: the ultrastructure of small cells, the structural biology of HIV, and the further development of cryoEM technology.

## Shrawan Mageswaran {-#shrawan_mageswaran}

## Alasdair McDowall {-#alasdair_mcdowall}

Alasdair McDowall is manager for the laboratory of Grant Jensen at Caltech. He is a career electron microscopist of 48 years and has managed, designed and directed microscopy centers and resources in the UK, USA, Germany and Australia. He is Emeritus Professor at the University of Queensland, Australia. He received his Doctorate from the University of Sorbonne, Paris.  His thesis was enhanced by the unique discovery in 1981 when Dubochet and McDowall at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) reported the first vitrification of water at ambient pressures as seen in the electron microscope.  This landmark result pioneered research that evolved into modern day molecular cryo-electron microscopy and the awarding of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Dubochet, Henderson and Frank. In 2019 he was appointed a Queen Elizabeth II honors recipient, and awarded Member of the Order of Australia.  “For significant service to science, particularly in the field of electron microscopy”.

## Lauren Ann Metskas {-#lauren_ann_metskas}

## Gavin Murphy {-#gavin_murphy}

Following his graduation from the University of Dallas, Gavin Murphy spent two years studying X-ray crystallography as a Fulbright Scholar at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Hamburg, Germany. He then joined the lab of Grant Jensen at Caltech, applying cryo-electron tomography to solve the structures of bacterial macromolecular machinery. He received his doctorate in 2007, for work that included one of the first subtomogram averages ever published, revealing the ultrastructure of the flagellar motor. Wanting to make a more direct impact on human health, in his postdoctoral work with Sriram Subramanian at the National Institutes of Health he developed and applied methods for focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to visualize large volumes of eukaryotic cells and tissue. In 2012, Gavin became Director of the Electron Microscopy Center at Indiana University Bloomington. He died in 2017, and is fondly remembered and greatly missed by his colleagues.
