Getting help
------------

Inform readers of how they can contact you, or at least how they can report problems they may encounter.  This may simply be a request to use the issue tracker on your repository, but many projects have associated chat or mailing lists, and this section is a good place to mention those.


Contributing
------------

This section is optional; if your repository is for a project that accepts open-source contributions, then this section is where you can mention how people can offer contributions, and point them to your guidelines for contributing.  (If you delete this section, don't forget to remove the corresponding entry in the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) too.)
