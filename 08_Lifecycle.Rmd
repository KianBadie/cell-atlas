> “the microbial world consists almost entirely of bacteria in various degrees of starvation.”
- John Postgate [@postgate1994]

## Stationary Phase
Your cell is fairly well optimized now. It can grow, divide, and find fuel to repeat the process. But what happens when there is no food is to be found? Natural environments offer famine more often than feast. And conditions can become harsh (high temperature, low pH, little water). For minor shortages of carbon or phosphate, your cell can fall back on its storage granules. But what about more prolonged starvation or stress? To outlast these conditions, your cell would do well to hunker down and conserve its remaining energy. Cells have evolved just such a mechanism: a **stationary** (non-growing) state. When conditions are no longer optimal for growth, the cell stops protein production and compacts its nucleoid to protect the DNA from damage, as you can see in this *Caulobacter crescentus*. The cell also shrinks its cytoplasm either by dividing at a smaller size, or by digesting nonessential components and cinching down its membrane (stressed cells often contain more cytoplasmic vesicles). Some diderm bacteria, including *C. crescentus*, also remodel their cell walls and outer membranes (releasing extracellular vesicles). Others, like *Escherichia coli*, do not, resulting in a larger periplasm. In stationary phase, rod-shaped cells become more round. Nonessential protein assemblies are lost; note the missing surface layer on this cell. When cells no longer have energy to spare to power motility, they also lose their flagella (see them floating next to these cells) and dismantle their chemosensory arrays. The cell now plays a waiting game. If the environment changes, your cell can resume active growth. Or the death of a neighboring cell, like the one you see here, might release a burst of nutrients that your cell can use for one more round of growth and division, producing progeny that might find a better life. Unlike in a well-maintained laboratory culture, in Nature bacteria and archaea spend most of their time in stationary phase, awaiting fleeting opportunities for growth.

## Genome Protection
Remember that the most critical part of your cell is its instruction manual–the genome. Ensuring that the instructions remain intact is paramount to your cell in stationary phase. To do this, all cells have proteins (RecA in bacteria, RadA in archaea, and Rad51 in eukaryotes) that repair DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species, UV (or other) radiation, heat, or other sources. **RecA** (and related) proteins form complexes with the DNA they protect. These ordered arrays can become quite extensive in stationary phase cells, like this *Helicobacter pylori*.

This cell exhibits other hallmarks of stationary phase: its shrinking membranes have produced vesicles and it has shed its flagella. It has not yet (at least fully) digested its chemosensory array. Note also the relatively weak association of the outer membrane with this pathogenic diderm, allowing the cell to curl up inside.

## Archaeal Stationary Phase
Stationary phase in archaea looks much the same as in bacteria, as you can see in this *Thermococcus kodakaraensis*. The cell has shrunk to about half its size in active growth, partly by shedding vesicles, and much of the surface layer has been dismantled. It has lost its archaella (though the conical plate in the cytoplasm remains) and degraded its chemosensory array, and is protecting its genome with **RadA** filaments. Now it waits for things to get better.

## Differentiation
While all cells go through cycles of growth and quiescence in response to changes in their environment, some species have gone a step further to evolve a programmed set of states–a **lifecycle**. In some cases, as you will see in the next chapter, a lifecycle allows bacteria to prey efficiently on other cells, including ours. In other cases, such as these *Caulobacter crescentus*, it allows the bacterium to thrive in an environment with low nutrient levels. *C. crescentus* has a **dimorphic** (“two form”) lifecycle. Newborn cells start out life as **swarmers**, with a polar flagellum. They swim through the environment (either freshwater or saltwater) until they (hopefully) reach a favorable spot to put down roots, which they do by first transiently attaching to a surface with pili, then making the attachment permanent with a polymer of a sticky protein called “**holdfast**,” which currently holds the record for the strongest known biological adhesive [More: Holdfast](#Holdfast). They shed their flagellum and grow a stalk in its place. Only after growing a stalk, completing the process of differentiation, will the cell begin to divide. The **stalked cell** will remain attached to the surface for the rest of its life, dividing asymmetrically to produce new swarmer cells, which swim away to try their luck elsewhere. Here you see a swarmer cell on the bottom, and a stalked cell on the top, in the process of dividing to produce another swarmer that would swim off to the right. You saw a similar dimorphic lifecycle in Chapter 5, in sessile (non-motile) *Hyphomonas neptunium* that bud to produce motile daughters. This kind of lifecycle helps prevent related cells from competing with one another for scarce local nutrients.

### More: Holdfast{-#Holdfast}
*Prosthecobacter vanneervenii* is a stalked bacterium like *Caulobacter crescentus*, and attaches to surfaces by the same mechanism: a sticky ball of holdfast at the tip of its stalk. Here you see four cells whose stalks have attached to one another. Unlike its cousin *C. crescentus*, however, *P. vanneervenii* is non-motile (no flagellum) and does not have a dimorphic life cycle. It divides symmetrically.

## Monoderm Sporulation
The strategies we just discussed can help your cell deal with lean times. But what if things get *really* bad? Maybe you need to build your cell a survivalist bunker. Several species of bacteria do just this, using a modified cell division program to create a special reinforced daughter cell called a **spore**. Spores are extremely resistant to dehydration, acid, heat and other dangers. They are a purely dormant cell form, neither growing nor dividing, but simply waiting for improved conditions.

Some bacterial species form **exospores**, which are released directly to the environment as in a normal division. Others, like monoderm *Bacillus subtilis*, form **endospores**, which mature inside the protective envelope of the mother cell. As you can see in this cell, the first step resembles an asymmetric (closer to one pole) but otherwise normal cell division, with a septum of cell wall separating the compartment that will become the spore. Unlike in regular monoderm division, though, in which the septum is the same thickness as the rest of the cell wall, the **sporulation septum** is thinner, containing fewer layers of peptidoglycan. Also unlike division, the septum seems to form very rapidly [More: Sporulation septum formation](#Sporulation_septum_formation).

*Note that this cell (and the ones on the next two pages) is narrower than normal *B. subtilis*; a cell wall remodeling enzyme has been removed from its genome, leaving essential functions like cell wall growth and division (and sporulation) intact, but making the cells narrower and therefore better to image by cryoET.*

### More: Sporulation septum formation{-#Sporulation_septum_formation}
From hundreds of sporulating *Bacillus subtilis* we imaged by cryoET, this is the only cell captured in the process of forming a septum. As you can see, it is at a very early stage in the process. The fact that we do not see more intermediates suggests that once the septum starts to form, it quickly proceeds to completion.

## Monoderm Spore Engulfment
Once the septum is in place, it is then extended, as you can see in this *Bacillus subtilis* cell, enlarging the nascent spore and ultimately separating it from the mother cell envelope. Note that the monoderm mother is producing a diderm spore, surrounded by two layers of its mother’s membrane. As this occurs, a copy of the genome is pumped through a specialized protein nanomachine. The increased turgor pressure from the highly-concentrated DNA helps the spore round and expand. Usually, the mother cell membrane closes off at the cell pole, but occasionally this occurs instead on the side of the mother cell [More: Spore engulfment](#Spore_engulfment).

When the process of **engulfment** is finished, the spore’s cell wall is reinforced and expanded into a tough “**cortex**,” and an extra protein **coat** is added to the outside, completing the sturdy envelope that will protect the spore from harsh environments [More: Spore coating](#Spore_coating). Finally, when the spore is ready, the mother cell lyses, releasing the time capsule to its fate.

(ref:8-6) [Bacillus subtilis](#tree) Collected by: [Elitza Tocheva](#elitza_tocheva) Movie DOI: [10.22002/D1.1558](https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1558)

```

### More: Spore engulfment{-#Spore_engulfment}
The process of spore engulfment by the mother cell membrane culminates in closure of the membranes, creating an outer spore membrane and an inner spore membrane on either side of the sporulation septum. The final point of separation is usually at the center of the cell pole, but not always, as you can see in this *Bacillus subtilis* spore being engulfed from the side of the mother cell. The layer to the right of the developing spore may be a precursor of the coat [More: Spore coating](#Spore_coating).

```

### More: Spore coating{-#Spore_coating}
In this later stage of sporulation, you can see that the *Bacillus subtilis* spore has now separated completely from the mother cell envelope. It has also moved away from the cell pole. The layer flanking the spore may be the assembling spore coat.

(ref:8-6b) [Bacillus subtilis](#tree) Collected by: [Elitza Tocheva](#elitza_tocheva) Movie DOI: [10.22002/D1.1567](https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1567)

## Monoderm Spores
Fully mature *Bacillus subtilis* spores like this one are ovoid, and swollen with armor, including the thick cortex and multilayered coat. This dense shield protects the cargo within from drying out, or denaturing in heat or acid. (It also makes it hard to make out much internal detail in images.)

Once released, the spore will remain dormant as long as necessary, protected by its carbohydrate and protein armor, waiting for optimal conditions of water, temperature and pH to germinate. The wait can be long, sometimes very, very, *very* long. In one case, *Bacillus subtilis* spores were revived from a salt crystal thought to have formed 250 million years ago.

(ref:8-7) [Bacillus subtilis](#tree) Collected by: [Elitza Tocheva](#elitza_tocheva) Movie DOI: [10.22002/D1.1559](https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1559)

```

## Monoderm Germination
When conditions become conducive to growth, the spore will return to an active state, shedding its protein coat and outer membrane and dismantling its cortex to allow outgrowth of the reviving cell, as you see in this **germinating** *Bacillus subtilis* spore.

The ready transition between a monoderm cell with a thick cell wall and a diderm spore with a thin septal wall may provide a hint to the origin of diderm bacterial cells. Perhaps a spore, maybe released prematurely from its mother before its septum had thickened into a full cortex, kept growing and dividing with both membranes and a thin cell wall. Evolution could then tinker with the second membrane, specializing it into the modern bacterial outer membrane.

(ref:8-8) [Bacillus subtilis](#tree) Collected by: [Elitza Tocheva](#elitza_tocheva) Movie DOI: [10.22002/D1.1560](https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1560)

## Diderm Sporulation
Sporulation is not limited to monoderms. A few species of diderm bacteria also form spores (some exospores and others endospores). The process is much the same as in monoderms, despite the different cell envelope structure. It begins with an asymmetric septum close to one pole of the cell, as you can see in this *Acetonema longum*. As in monoderms, the septum contains a thin layer of peptidoglycan (remember that diderms have a thin cell wall, though, so the thickness is about the same as in the rest of the cell).

(ref:8-9) [Acetonema longum](#tree) Collected by: [Elitza Tocheva](#elitza_tocheva) Movie DOI: [10.22002/D1.1561](https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1561)

```

## Diderm Spore Engulfment
Engulfment also proceeds similarly, as you can see in this *Acetonema longum* cell, with the septum expanding and moving to cinch off at the pole of the mother cell [More: Complete engulfment](#Complete_engulfment). As the cell wall is remodeled to accomplish this, the rod shape of the mother is lost. Note also how the outer membrane of the mother cell ruffles and expands, apparently having detached from the cell wall. Compared to a daughter cell produced by division, there is something quite interesting about the envelope of the endospore. Look carefully at the membranes. Both the inner and outer membranes of the spore derive from the inner membrane of the mother cell. This implies a surprising interchangeability of the two membrane types, and lends further credence to the idea that the outer membrane of some or all diderm bacteria originally came from a monoderm spore that failed to shed its second membrane.

As you saw in *Bacillus subtilis*, once engulfment is complete, the thin septal wall will be expanded and reinforced into a thick cortex and a protective protein coat will be added before the mature spore is released by lysis of the mother cell [More: Mature spore](#Mature_spore).  *A. longum* spores are round, but other rod-shaped diderms form ovoid spores [More: Sporomusa acidovorans sporulation](#Sporomusa_acidovorans_sporulation).

### More: Complete engulfment{-#Complete_engulfment}
This *Acetonema longum* cell has completed engulfment, creating a “forespore.” *Acetonema longum* forespores (and mature spores) typically contain several granules, likely storing poly-phosphate. These may help power outgrowth when the spore germinates. Spores from other species, though, like *Bacillus subtilis*, do not contain obvious storage granules, so they may serve another, species-specific role.

### More: Mature spore{-#Mature_spore}
This mature *Acetonema longum* spore has been released by lysis of its mother cell. Note its extensive armor: a thick cortex between the membranes, and a multilayered protein coat.

### More: Sporomusa acidovorans sporulation{-#Sporomusa_acidovorans_sporulation}
This diderm *Sporomusa acidovorans* cell is in the process of forming an ovoid endospore. Note also what may be an early stage of cortex formation at the end of the spore, as well as novel structures at the points of cell wall remodeling. We do not know what they are, but they may be involved in engulfment.

## Diderm Germination
Again, when the spore encounters favorable conditions, it will germinate, as this *Acetonema longum* spore is doing. Unlike the *Bacillus subtilis* you saw earlier, germinating diderm spores do not shed their outer membrane. Instead, they remodel their cortex back into a thin cell wall (compare to the mature spore on the previous page). This process is a good reminder of the similarity of monoderm and diderm cell walls; they may look very different, but their fundamental architecture is the same, just with more sheets of material in monoderms (and spores). After the remodel, the cell then sheds its protein coat, as you see here, and starts to grow.

Some archaea also have resistant forms similar to bacterial spores. For instance, when water levels drop in its salty environment, rod-shaped *Halobacterium salinarum* uses a variant division process to produce three or four hardy spherical cells that can survive dormant in halite crystals for tens of thousands of years, awaiting water to revive.

Sporulation may seem like a highly specialized function practiced by relatively few species, but there is reason to think that it may have evolved long ago and been key to the success of life on Earth. Conditions today are extremely clement compared to what they likely were a few billion years ago, when the last common ancestor of all modern cells (called **LUCA**, for <u>L</u>ast <u>U</u>niversal <u>C</u>ommon <u>A</u>ncestor) may have lived. It is quite possible that LUCA was a spore, the only form of life hardy enough to survive conditions volatile and violent enough to kill off the spore’s ancestors. If so, most modern lineages of bacteria and archaea simply lost the ability to form spores when it was no longer essential to their survival. It is further possible that a LUCA spore was formed by a cell somewhere else in the solar system and delivered to Earth on one of the asteroids that bombarded the planet in its infancy. We may never know, but the possibilities are fun to consider.
